# CeresWebApp
This is the finalized (sort of) WORKING version of the CERES Monitoring Web App that can collect real time data, navigation, handle user registration, and logging in using Auth0, with the latest designs from Willie that has been converted to REACT. 

Anymore changes please use this repo instead of the old ReactMVCNotCSHTML. Some updates from the previous repo was not pulled prior to this repo due to an already working version I didn't want to conflict the codes.
